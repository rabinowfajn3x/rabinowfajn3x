I am just a normal student from czechia, and I have interest in programming (As you can probably tell :D)

Other that that, I like to play Guitar and take photos, don't hesitate to reach out to me! ^^

The project that I am most proud of is discord bot that launches and manages minecraft servers

If you want to contact me on discord, my name is also rabinowfajn3x
